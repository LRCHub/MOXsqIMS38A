[00:23.33] Are we really happy with this lonely game we play?
[00:32.16] Looking for the right words to say
[00:40.25] Searching but not finding
[00:43.79] Understanding anyway
[00:48.12] We're lost in this masquerade
[01:02.62] 
[00:57.56] Both afraid to say we're just too far away
[01:05.88] From being close together from the start
[01:14.35] We tried to talk it over, but the words got in the way
[01:22.66] We're lost inside this lonely game we play
[01:43.66] 
[01:31.90] Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
[01:40.77] And no matter how hard I try
[01:48.73] To understand the reasons why we carry on this way
[01:56.90] We're lost in this masquerade
[02:11.40] 
[03:00.97] We tried to talk it over, but the words got in the way
[03:09.05] We're lost inside this lonely game we play
[03:18.02] Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
[03:27.10] And no matter how hard I try
[03:35.05] To understand the reason why we carry on this way
[03:43.11] We're lost in a masquerade
[03:51.87] We're lost in a masquerade
[04:04.87] 
[04:07.51] (And we're lost in a masquerade)
