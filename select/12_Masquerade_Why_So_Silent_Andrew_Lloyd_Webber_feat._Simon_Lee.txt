Monsieur Andre!
Monsieur Firmin!

Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed
Well, one does one's best

Here's to us
The toast for the city
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here!

Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade!
Hide your face so the world will never find you

Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade!
Look around, there's another mask behind you

Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast

Faces!
Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round
In an inhuman race

Eye of gold, thigh of blue
True is false, who is who?
Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown

Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned in the light, in the sound
But who can name the face?

Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade!
Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you

Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade!
Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you

Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade!
Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you

What a night, what a crowd!
Makes you glad, makes you proud!
All the crème de la crème
Watching us, watching them (and all our fears are in the past)

Three months
Of relief, of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last

No more notes, no more ghost
Here's a health, here's a toast
To a prosperous year
To our friends who are here

And may the splendour never fade (what a joy, what a change)
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!

Think of it
A secret engagement
Look, your future bride
Just think of it

But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me

No, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime

Christine, what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue (let's not argue)
Please pretend (I can only hope)
You will understand in time (I'll understand in time)

Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade!
Hide your face so the world will never find you

Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade!
Look around, there's another mask behind you

Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade!
Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you

Why so silent, good Messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good Messieurs?
I have written you an opera

Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts

Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting around the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age

And my managers must learn
That their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daaé...

No doubt she'll do her best
It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though

Should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...

Your chains are still mine
You belong to me!
