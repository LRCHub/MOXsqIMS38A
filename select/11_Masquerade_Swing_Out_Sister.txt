A thousand words can hide
Behind averted eyes
Emotionless
In a web of lies

Forbidden thoughts you keep
Awake you when you sleep
The truth is blind
To your cold deceit

Turning your face away from a truth you'll never find
Behind this masquerade

Turning your back says much more than words could ever hide
Behind this masquerade

You've gone too far
To stop hiding behind this masquerade

A force of evil reigns
As silence stakes its claim
Invisible
As a grieved heart prays

When innocence is lost
Your conscience pays the cost
No sacrifice
Will bring back the past

Playing for time you'll find tomorrow never comes
Behind this masquerade

Living a lie you'll soon find what you've been running from
Behind this masquerade

You've gone too far
To stop hiding behind this masquerade

You've gone too far
To stop living behind this masquerade
