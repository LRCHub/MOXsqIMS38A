It's not safe
To show my face
Must stay in masquerade
What I hide
No one can find
Cover me in masquerade

How long can I suppress
The voices fighting to be free?
Can you hear my silent screams?

How much can I endure
The burning of suspicious eyes?
They could be my own demise

It's not safe
To show my face
Must stay in masquerade
What I hide
No one can find
Cover me in masquerade

It's not safe
To show my face
Must stay in masquerade
What I hide
No one can find
Cover me in masquerade

I don't wanna get hurt
Don't need a reason why
When love rises to the surface
Bury it alive
When you're runnin' on empty
It's never what it seems
Shadows all around your dreams

Don't wanna get hurt
Don't wanna get hurt
Don't wanna get hurt
Don't wanna get hurt

Shadows all around
All-around
Shadows all around

It's not safe
To show my face
Must stay in masquerade
What I hide
No one can find
Cover me in masquerade
Cover me in masquerade
Cover me in masquerade

I don't wanna get hurt
Don't need a reason why
When love rises to the surface
Bury it alive
When you're runnin' on empty
It's never what it seems
Shadows all around your dreams

It's not safe
To show my face
Must stay in masquerade
What I hide
No one can find
Cover me in masquerade

It's not safe
To show my face
Must stay in masquerade
What I hide
No one can find
Cover me in masquerade
