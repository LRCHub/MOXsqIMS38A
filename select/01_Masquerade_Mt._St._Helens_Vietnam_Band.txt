Dressing up, down to the cuffs.
Stepping out into a jaded crowd.

Pass through everybody,
Don't look at anyone,
Ask where the gardens are,
To see if you are hiding there.
Pass through everybody
Don't look at anyone,
Ask where the spirits are,
To see if you're imbibing them.

Push through everybody,
Don't stare at anyone.
Ask where the bedroom is,
To see if you are dressing there.
Push through everybody,
Don't stare at anyone.
Ask where the ballroom is,
To see that you are waltzing there:

It's a masquerade,
But I've been more afraid,
I've been chasing you through the night.
It's a miracle I've been seeing you;
I've been blinding myself lately.

It's a masquerade,
But I've been more afraid,
I've been chasing you all through the night.
It's a miracle I've been seeing you;
I've been blinding myself,
But then you go all the way 'round,
Knowing that I couldn't help being shy;
I couldn't meet your eyes.

Wrap you up because I must,
Away from another's touch.

I saw everybody,
I stared at everyone,
You were the grandest one,
You were the pinnacle.
